She hangs on to her intuition as tightly as she would onto the last thread of hope linking her to her lover. A former sergeant tells her in vain that Manech died in the no man's land of a trench named Bingo Crepescule, in the company of four other men condemned to die for self-inflicted wounds.

There's just footage of whatever happened as it was happening: it takes the viewer from initial concept to casting, rehearsals, costume fittings, creating disfigured bodies, dialogue replacement, editing, composing... If that's not enough, there are, on the same DVD, shorter segments on the creation of 1920s Paris and the zeppelin explosion.",
